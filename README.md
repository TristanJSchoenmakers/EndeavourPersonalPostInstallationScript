**!!Under construction!!**

My personal post-installation script for Ubuntu.
Installs all the software and packages I need on my fresh install.

## Getting started

#### Download the script & place it in the home directory

#### Update the permissions of the script
Open up a terminal window on Ubuntu by pressing *Ctrl + Alt + T* or *Ctrl + Shift + T* on the keyboard.
Then, update the permissions of the script with the chmod command.
``` bash
sudo chmod +x ~/ubuntu-post-installer.sh
```

#### Run the script
``` bash
sudo bash ubuntu-post-installer.sh   
```
